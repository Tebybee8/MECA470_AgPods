## 1. Introduction 
The goal of this project is to create an open hydroponic agriculture platform to streamline current systems that are inefficient and expensive. By utilizing an automated and low-cost concept, coupled with an AI robotic system, we aim to assist growers by tracking, identifying, and optimizing their growing recipes.

## 2. Cable Robot Degrees Of Freedom

By utilizing a 4-cable system robot, we are able to achieve a 6 degrees of freedom. We determined this by using Grubler's formula as seen below:


When inputting the variables for arms, links, joints, and calculating the DoF of the joints we recieved the spatial degree of freedom of 6.
